I'm developing web apps on Angular 2+ (now v. 10) and Typescript 3.4. and I have a firm knowledge of vanilla JS fundamentals (ES5, ES6).

I have 7-year experience in JS, HTML and CSS + preprocessors. I mainly use Sass/SCSS but also have used LESS and Stylus. I also use post-processing (Post CSS, npm modules for code minimization or prefixing) and easily deal with gulp and Webpack. Now, I am learning Node.js.

## Experience
### Russian Railways
#### Frontend Developer 2019 - Present

When I started to work on Russian Railways transpot portal I was discouraged with its condition on frontend: no grid, no methodology, poor styling (repeats itself, has errors, 30% is legacy and 30% is not used). What about Angular, there were cyclic dependencies, сomponents were large and were strongly bound to each other. I resolved problems with styles and layout. Being a part of a new team, whose main
task was to refactor the whole project and develop new features, I've learned Angular 2+ and best practices.
I have gained extensive experience in developing UI components. 

Our team is building a UI library on Angular 10 for the new version of ticket issuance portal. 
We've built many isolated UI components as separated angular modules. Each has its own encapsulated styles and set of parameters. Parameters are component class's properties with @Input decorator. Some components like tabs or cards may take HTML content. All components styling is very flexible but strictly typed with CSS properties and separated themes layer. I've been working a lot of time on UI and UX as well as on frontend tasks. Therefore, I am very familiar with agile methods, sprints, complex git flow and time tracking.

## Plaify
Plaify was a social network for gamers and game developers). Now it's closed. I've been
 involved in development since the beginning. 
The entire UI was made by me. The main concept has changed several times, and I had to modify and improve the entire layout and style many times. Therefore, I learned how to perform refactoring effectively. In addition, I acquired skills that are important for project work and learned agile Scrum methods.
