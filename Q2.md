# Reedsy Front end Engineer Challenge — Q2

### 2.1. What kind of front end projects do you enjoy working on? Why?
I am looking for new experience, and I wish to develop my skills further.
On last two projects I got tired of refactoring, so I want to concentrate on developing new features.
I am always looking for proposals from biotech projects, technology startups, projects with social or cultural value.
The company I'm looking for should respect anyone who is engaged in the job and create a friendly working atmosphere.

### 2.2. Which are your favorite features of HTML5? How have you used them before?
1. Content preload
2. Semantic tags
3. Canvas
4. Browser validation and new `input` types that extend forms functionality

### 2.3. Explain the difference between creating a DOM element setting innerHTML and using createElement.
`innerHTML` method clears all DOM nodes inside the target element and recreates the content of a parent element.

`createElement` just creates an HTML element. It's not inside DOM yet until `appendChild` is used.

`appendChild` method adds an element to the end of the parent's child elements list.

### 2.4. Compare two-way data binding vs one-way data flow.
Two-way data binding is a concept used in data-driven JS frameworks like Angular and Vue. 

One-way data flow — the view passes data to the model. If data changes then, the view doesn't know it.<br>
Two-way data binding — the view and the model are in sync. When the data changes, DOM re-renders.

One-way data flow — parent component passes data down to its children.
Two-way data binding — children may interact with a parent component. 
For example, the child component emits an event, the parent component catches it and updates data. Then it triggers the view update.

### 2.5. Why is asynchronous programming important in JavaScript?
In real life, we deal with constantly changing data, which needs to be re-received regularly, updated, or calculated in real-time.
Asynchronous programming allows waiting for long-running operations without freezing the entire program.
It allows many actions to be run at the same time instead of running them one after another, reducing the performance of the application.
